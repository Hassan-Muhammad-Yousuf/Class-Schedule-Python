Introduction to Class Scheduling Genetic Algorithm
The code implements a genetic algorithm to solve the class scheduling problem, 
a common optimization challenge in educational institutions. Class scheduling involves assigning courses to specific timeslots,
instructors, and rooms while adhering to various constraints such as room capacity, 
instructor availability, and course prerequisites. The goal is to create a feasible and efficient schedule that minimizes conflicts and maximizes resource utilization.
